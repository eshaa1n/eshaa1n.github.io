## About Me

I'm a **Computer Science graduate from the University of Nottingham** and currently a **Product Manager & Engineer at Chirpse**, where I led the product from idea to App Store launch in November.  

📱 **Chirpse — Match, chat & date** — [Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/chirpse-match-chat-date/id6742786155)

I thrive in **fast-paced, hands-on environments**, collaborating closely with engineering teams to turn ideas into real products that users love.

> **Note on activity graph:** Most of my day-to-day work is on **GitLab**, so GitHub activity may appear minimal. I have attatched a screenshot of my activity on GitLab below.
